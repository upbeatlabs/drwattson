## Python Library for Upbeat Labs Dr. Wattson board (and MCP39F521)

Python library to use with *Dr. Wattson Energy Monitoring Board* or other MCP39F521 based boards with a Raspberry Pi (or Beaglebone Black).

Specifically designed for use with Dr. Wattson Energy Monitoring Board --> [https://www.tindie.com/products/10722/](https://www.tindie.com/products/10722/)

Dr. Wattson is an Energy Monitoring Breakout Board for Arduino and other Maker-Friendly Microcontrollers. Easily integrate quality AC energy measurements into your next project!

Based on the **MCP39F521**, a single-phase power monitoring chip from **Microchip**, the board is designed to be tolerant of a wide range of voltages, which means that it can also be used with the Raspberry Pi or any other 3.3v MCUs just as easily.

The unit comes pre-calibrated (enabling measurements from 1mA up to 4A) to enable you to start taking quality measurements on the get-go with just a couple of simple commands. You don't need any additional CT or other components. 

If you are a more advanced user, you have a wide range of functionality available from the rich library, as well as the ability to tweak the hardware to suit your needs and recalibrate using the library.

## Prerequisites

Enable I2C on the Raspberry Pi

Refer to Dr. Wattson User Manual to set up Dr. Wattson

## Installing

```
sudo python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
sudo pip install UpbeatLabs_MCP39F521 --upgrade
```
Or alternatively:

```
sudo python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
git clone https://github.com/upbeatlabs/drwattson.git
cd drwattson/Python
sudo python setup.py install
```

## Usage

### Connect Dr. Wattson

See Dr. Wattson User Manual for more details.

![RPI & Dr. Wattson Wiring](RPI_DrWattson_wiring.png)

Here is the wiring, from left to right

* SCL to RPI (physical) pin 5 (SCL)
* SDA to RPI (physical) pin 3 (SDA)
* ZCD pin (optional) - RPI (physical) pin 16 (GPIO23) (or any available GPIO pin)
* Event pin (optional) - RPI (physical) pin 18 (GPIO24) (or any available GPIO pin)
* GND to RPI (physical) pin 14 (GND)
* Vin to RPI (physical) pin 1 (3.3v)
* 3.3v to RPI (physical) pin 17 (3.3v)
* GND to RPI (physical) pin 9 (GND)

Optionally, 
* connect LED Anode to RPI (physical) pin 12 (GPIO18) (or any available GPIO pin) via 220 ohm resistor
* connect LED Cathode to RPI (physical) pin 6 (GND)

### Test I2C connection
Use i2cdetect -y 1 to test the connection. Dr. Wattson uses (by default) an I2C address of 0x74.

[Note: you can configure the addressing using two solder jumpers on the board, for a total of 4 possible combinations (that correspond to addresses of 0x74, 0x75, 0x76 or 0x77). This means that you can connect up to 4 Dr. Wattson boards using a single MCU]

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ i2cdetect -y 1
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f

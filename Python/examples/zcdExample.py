# *************************************************** 
#   This is a example program for Upbeat Labs Dr. Wattson Energy Monitoring Breakout
#   --> https://www.tindie.com/products/UpbeatLabs/dr-wattson-energy-monitoring-board-2/

#   This example demonstrates getting ZCD (Zero Cross Detection) interrupts. 
#   These can be used to trigger a triac, for example, to act as a light dimmer. 

#   Note that the LED_PIN on your RPi will flash about 1 time a second, 
#   in response to the ZCD input that is scaled down (from the 120 times a second
#   that the interrupt will get called in response to CHANGEing values of the pin - 
#   60Hz will change from high to low and low to high twice per cycle, hence 120
#   times a second). SLOW_DOWN_FACTOR of 60 means that the LED will toggle
#   twice a second - or in other words, it lights up every second!

#   The communication happens over I2C. 2 pins are required to interface. 
#   There are 4 selectable I2C address possibilities per board (selectable
#   via two solder jumpers (that select each pin to be high or low). Based 
#   on this, there are 4 possible addresses:

#   I2C address  SJ1   SJ2
#   0x74         LOW   LOW
#   0x75         LOW   HIGH
#   0x76         HIGH  LOW
#   0x77         HIGH  HIGH

#   There are 2 output pins - ZCD and EVENT that generate external
#   interrupts. In this example, ZCD is not is connected to 
#   GPIO BMC pin 23 (physical pin 15). When ZCD pin is turned on/off
#   an interrupt is generated and invokes the zcd_handler, which
#   toggles the state of the LED (on physical pin 12, BCM pin 18)
#   at the rate determined by the SLOW_DOWN_FACTOR. The EVENT pin is
#   not used in this example.

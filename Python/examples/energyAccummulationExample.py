# *************************************************** 
#   This is a example program for Upbeat Labs Dr. Wattson Energy Monitoring Breakout
#   --> https://www.tindie.com/products/UpbeatLabs/dr-wattson-energy-monitoring-board-2/

#   This example demonstrates enabling energy accumulation on Dr. Wattson.

#   The program starts to poll the module for Energy data and prints it out in a loop.

#   Turn on the input power to see the voltage RMS, line frequency values 
#   change to the appropriate values. 

#   Turn on the load attached to your output to see current RMS, power factor, 
#   active, reactive and apparent power values change. Also see the
#   accumulated energy data increasing with time when the load is on.

#   The communication happens over I2C. 2 pins are required to interface. 
#   There are 4 selectable I2C address possibilities per board (selectable
#   via two solder jumpers (that select each pin to be high or low). Based 
#   on this, there are 4 possible addresses:

#   I2C address  SJ1   SJ2
#   0x74         LOW   LOW
#   0x75         LOW   HIGH
#   0x76         HIGH  LOW
#   0x77         HIGH  HIGH

# Upbeat Labs Dr. Wattson Energy Monitoring Board Library

Libraries for use with *Dr. Wattson Energy Monitoring Board*

Dr. Wattson is an Energy Monitoring Breakout Board for Arduino, Raspberry Pi and other Maker-Friendly Microcontrollers. Easily integrate quality AC energy measurements into your next project!

Based on the **MCP39F521**, a single-phase power monitoring chip from **Microchip**, the board is designed to be tolerant of a wide range of voltages, which means that it can also be used with the Raspberry Pi or any other 3.3v MCUs just as easily.

The unit comes pre-calibrated (enabling measurements from 1mA up to 4A) to enable you to start taking quality measurements on the get-go with just a couple of simple commands. You don't need any additional CT or other components. 

If you are a more advanced user, you have a wide range of functionality available from the rich library, as well as the ability to tweak the hardware to suit your needs and recalibrate using the library.
